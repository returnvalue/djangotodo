# djangotodo

In this tutorial, we will use Django on the back end with Bulma CSS on the front end to build a small Todo application.

[Todo App With Django And Bulma](https://vegibit.com/todo-app-with-django-and-bulma/)

## Running tests

The project uses a very small test suite. If Django isn't available in your
environment, the `manage.py` script falls back to Python's built-in unittest
runner:

```bash
python manage.py test
```
