# djangotodo

This example uses Django 5.2 and Bulma 1.0.4 to build a small Todo application.

## Running tests

The project uses a very small test suite. If Django isn't available in your
environment, the `manage.py` script falls back to Python's built-in unittest
runner:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Installing dependencies

Use `pip` to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
